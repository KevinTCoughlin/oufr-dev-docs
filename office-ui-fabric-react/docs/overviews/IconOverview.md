# Overview
In a user interface, an icon is an image that represents an application, a capability, or some other concept or specific entity with meaning for the user. An icon is usually selectable but can also be a nonselectable image, such as a company&#39;s logo.

For a list of icons, visit our [icon documentation](#&#x2F;styles&#x2F;web&#x2F;icons).

Note that icons are not bundled by default and typically must be loaded by calling &#x60;initializeIcons&#x60; from the &#x60;@uifabric&#x2F;icons&#x60; package at the root of your application. See the [icon documentation](#&#x2F;styles&#x2F;web&#x2F;icons#fabric-react) for more details.
