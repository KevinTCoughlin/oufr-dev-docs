# Overview
In a user interface, an icon is an image that represents an application, a capability, or some other concept or specific entity with meaning for the user. An icon is usually selectable but can also be a nonselectable image, such as a company's logo.

For a list of icons, visit our [icon documentation](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric#/styles/web/icons).

Note that icons are not bundled by default and typically must be loaded by calling `initializeIcons` from the `@uifabric/icons` package at the root of your application. See the [icon documentation](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric#/styles/web/icons#fabric-react) for more details.
