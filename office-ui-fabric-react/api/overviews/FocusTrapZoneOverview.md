## Overview
FocusTrapZone is used to trap the focus in any html element. Pressing tab will circle focus within the inner focusable elements of the FocusTrapZone.

**Note:** Trapping focus will restrict interaction with other elements in the website such as the side nav. Turn off the &quot;Use trap zone&quot; toggle control to allow this interaction to happen again.
